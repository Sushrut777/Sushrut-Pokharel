        <p style="line-height: 40px;">
            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.<br>
            I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning.<br> 
            I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.<br>
            I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.<br>
            I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone.<br>
            I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.<br>
             I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
        </p>

            A career summary is brief, general statement on a resume that includes overview of experience, responsibilities of a job, skills, and accomplishments.<br>
             The career summary is the first item on the resume, after the contact information and serves as an introduction to the rest of the resume.<br>

            Career summary is often targeted to the job in which the applicant is interested. The main goal of a career summary is to share the most immpresive qualifications relevant to the job up front and grab the hiring manager's attention with it.
